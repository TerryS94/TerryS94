Hi😄

Most of my projects live in private repos or outside GitHub, but every now and then I make an effort to open source something.

I primarily build tools and systems in C++, with occasional web or Python work sprinkled in.

My other lifelong interests include music and playing guitar🎸

If you find my work useful/interesting, consider hitting the follow button! And if you'd like to support me even further, I'd really appreciate a [sponsorship](https://www.github.com/sponsors/TerryS94).♥️
